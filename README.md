### Hello there! 👋

🔭 Hi, I'm Swadhin, a software engineering MTS at Salesforce! Previously, I worked on baking privacy and software into data clean rooms at LiveRamp!

I graduated with a master's in Privacy Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and I also hold a bachelor's in CS from Manipal Institute of Technology. 

I'm passionate about privacy-enhancing technologies and their intersection with software engineering that has an impact on the daily lives of users. Some of them, not limited to, are Big Data & Distributed Systems, Differential Privacy, Private Set Intersection, Browser Security, and Cloud Security.

I aim to learn more about these concepts and build real-world applications with them to act as a stepping stone for developing enterprise-based solutions.
