### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Hi, I'm Swadhin, a Privacy and Software Development Engineer at LiveRamp!

I graduated with a Masters in Privacy Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and I also hold a bachelors in CS from Manipal Institute of Technology. 

I'm passionate about privacy-enhancing technologies and their intersection with software engineering that has an impact on the daily lives of users. Some of them, not limited to, are, Differential Privacy, Private Set Intersection, Browser Security, and Cloud Security.

I aim to learn more about these concepts and build real-world applications with them to act as a stepping stone for developing enterprise-based solutions.
